When I was young, existence of my grandma was not a big deal to me. She has lived far away from where I'm living until now and we could meet only on main national holidays like Happy New year's day and Chuseok, the Korean harvest day. Of course I know she is the mother of my mom but I couldn't feel much intimacy. 'Out of sight, out of mind' is a real wise saying, I guess. But blood is thicker than water too. When I visited and saw her smile at me with true happiness, while staggering because of trouble with her knees, I could feel real warm in those little families altogether.

My first memory with her was her early 60s, so I don't know much about her young and middle ages. And I didn't think any harder about her life. She was just her, in her 60s, whom I visit only on holidays and some occassions. That was all to me.

But sometimes she visited her daughter's house for several days every year. She was uncomfortable with her moving so she mostly stayed at home and talked to his daughter, my mom. I have a memory with her in our home. You know, when I was young I payed Kumon, a famous home-school materials' brand in Korea, and had studied math with it. I was about 8 or 9 and scope I was into was multiplying two 2-digit numbers like $$44 X 15$$. I had a problem with it so I asked my grandma because she was right next to me. I guess she was watching a television. When I asked her, she didn't say anything. My mother said 'grandma can't do multiplication of numbers'. I was somewhat surprised because it was unimaginable in my world. It was the very basic math. The reason was she wasn't educated enough in her early ages because of her poor home environment. But I didn't know of it at that age. I didn't say any further out of my mouth until now but I got to know she was out of my world, the bright side of 'Demian'.

10 years passed since then. I had undergone through many things and I was sitting by my large bookshelf on my right side. In that shelf, there were so many books: books when I read young, textbooks of college, computer science books, evolution books, etc. With them were cookbooks my mom had used when she was newly-married. They are about 30 years old and stained yellow now. In that sense, they infer history of our family, years of solitude.

My bookshelf was getting piled up with new books as the time passed so time had finally come that I needed to clean them up: getting rid of books I don't need anymore and moving my mom's books to her room and so on. My mom cooks really good and she doens't need those books anymore. That's why I planned to throw them away at first, not categorizing them into several sections cause it was boring to me. 

I took my mom's books out of the shelf and opened them once a while. While doing so, in a corner of the shelf, I found a black folder with some documents and there was no label on it. 'what is this?' came out of my mouth. I opened the folder and found history. Opening it were a bunch of letters between my mom and grandmother. My mom was from Busan and she came Seoul when she was 19 to work at a bank where she met my father there. So mom and grandma were far away from each other and there were no SNS, smart phones to contact easily. So they mailed to each other for several years and my mom has kept letters of her mom there and I found them.

As I said before, what I have seen and expected from my grandma was oldness, weakness and fishy smell of Jeotgal I couldn't stand. But grandma of the letters was totally different. She was a mom, and an woman. Although her spellings were quite uncorrect and her writings were crooked, I could feel unconditional love for daughter and concerns for city life with whole my body. My mom had left replies of her feelings and concerns for her mom on every letter from his mother and there was complete love too. How can I describe it more, my word never can be enough for it and I'm sad. My mom and grandma is in their middle age and old age. Yes, they couldn't steer clear of time and wrinkles but... They also had their pure and innocent ages and their girls' generations. They were also women, not just one's mom and I thoughtlessly had defined their identities all through my life. I had felt them as a whole deep inside my heart.

I couldn't dare to read those letters more and closed the folder right away. Why? And I stopped cleaning up the shelf on a concern that I might dump out the records of their true and innocent love. I sighed deeply at that night and turned my head against the shelf. There was nothing I could do but sitting in front of my desk and staring at a closed window on the desk. Nothing more...

Another 10 years passed and it's now. My grandma is in poor health and not very good actually. She is at her middle 80s and a doctor says she can't make it until September. Her sons and daughters(including my mom) visits the hospital as many times as possible and I also visited too.

I guess it was Monday afternoon after working at Daitgirls. My mom had been at hospital since Sunday and I met her at the hospital room. At then, grandma had lost her consciousness and could say nothing when I saw her. I felt weird because everytime that I had visited her she smiled big to me. In stead, her eyes were closed and mouth were wide open. My grandma had been somewhat plump when I was young but she was had lost so much weight and I was so surprised. Actually it was like looking at a live mummy. I shut my mouth up.

My mom said come over to grandma and say anything for her and she could hear what I say even though they're unconscious. I walked by her side but I could not say much. Her hands and legs swelled up so much and it was like those of new born babies. I couldn't help but stepping back because I had not much to say to her. That was what made me sad. I didn't have much to say even though she was my grandma.

At then my mom stepped close to grandma and told me she applied vaseline to grandma's lips. Surely, her lips gleamed and made a good contrast with other parts of her face. My mom patted her lips and said in smile, 'my mom is so pretty with vaseline on her lips. Isn't she?'. And I could feel that she really meant it. Yes, it was for sure. She was so confident that no sign of skepticism was shown to me. To be frank, grandma at then was like a live mummy to me but I changed my mind sincerely. 'True love says much more than my wrong bias', I had to admit it.

And I had to admit that their girls' generations are still going on and I want to make it last long with full of my heart. I found another reason to make my life full of achievements.
