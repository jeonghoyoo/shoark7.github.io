## About me!

<br>

I'm a student who wants to make value. Then you can ask me 'what is value?'.  
I think you can understand it when you look around my blog. :grin:

#### :ledger: Programming

* **Python**: It's my major language. I cover lots of basic Python here.  
* **Algorithm**: I love to divide problems into small subproblems and moduling. That's why I like algorithms.  
  - My algorithm repository is [here](https://github.com/shoark7/algorithm-with-python){:target="_blank"}.  **All my contents are in Python.**

* **Automation**: I'll deep dive more into this. It's for sure.
* **Shell scripts**: My small hobby is making a simple shell scripts.
* **Vim**: I use vim. You can check my .vimrc [here](https://github.com/shoark7/Daily-practice/blob/master/others/.vimrc){:target="_blank"}.  I hope you give me suggestions for better vim.
